\# 🌿 Crop Clinic



Machine learning-driven crop disease classification and remediation.



Crop Clinic is a web application that identifies plant diseases from leaf images using per-species convolutional neural networks, and generates treatment recommendations using the OpenAI API.



\## Features



\- \*\*14 crop species supported\*\* — Apple, Blueberry, Cherry, Corn, Grape, Orange, Peach, Pepper, Potato, Raspberry, Soybean, Squash, Strawberry, Tomato

\- \*\*38 disease classifications\*\* across all species

\- \*\*Per-species CNN models\*\* — a dedicated TensorFlow model for each crop, trained on the \[New Plant Diseases Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset)

\- \*\*Top-3 predictions\*\* with confidence bars

\- \*\*AI treatment recommendations\*\* powered by OpenAI GPT-4o-mini

\- \*\*Single-class species handling\*\* — Blueberry, Orange, Raspberry, Soybean, and Squash return their diagnosis instantly without a model



\## Tech Stack



\- \*\*Backend:\*\* Python 3.12, FastAPI, Uvicorn

\- \*\*ML Framework:\*\* TensorFlow / Keras (tf-nightly)

\- \*\*Frontend:\*\* HTML, CSS, JavaScript (no frameworks)

\- \*\*Treatment API:\*\* OpenAI GPT-4o-mini

\- \*\*Training:\*\* Jupyter Notebook, scikit-learn, matplotlib

```



\## Setup



\### 1. Clone the repo



```bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crop-clinic.git

cd crop-clinic

```



\### 2. Create a virtual environment



```bash

python -m venv .venv

.venv\\Scripts\\activate        # Windows

source .venv/bin/activate     # macOS/Linux

```



\### 3. Install dependencies



```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

```



\### 4. Set up API keys



Create a `.env` file in the project root:



```

OPENAI\_API\_KEY=sk-...your-key-here

```



For the training notebook, set up your \[Kaggle API token](https://www.kaggle.com/settings):



```

\# Windows

mkdir %USERPROFILE%\\.kaggle

echo YOUR\_TOKEN > %USERPROFILE%\\.kaggle\\access\_token

```



\### 5. Train models (if not included)



Open `crop\_clinic\_per\_species.ipynb` in VS Code or Jupyter and run all cells. This downloads the dataset and trains one model per species into the `models/` directory.



\### 6. Run the app



```bash

python app.py

```



Open http://localhost:5000 in your browser.



\## How It Works



1\. User selects a crop species from the dropdown

2\. User uploads a photo of a leaf

3\. The server resizes the image to 256×256 and passes it as a raw uint8 array to the appropriate per-species CNN model

4\. The model returns disease probabilities — the app displays the top prediction and confidence bars for the top 3

5\. User can request AI-generated treatment steps, which are fetched from the OpenAI API



\*\*Important:\*\* The models have a `Rescaling(1/255)` layer built in. Images must be passed as raw uint8 (0–255) without any normalization in the application code. Dividing by 255 before inference causes double-normalization and breaks all predictions.



\## Model Performance



| Species | Classes | Best Val Accuracy |

|---------|---------|-------------------|

| Apple | 4 | 95% |

| Cherry | 2 | 100% |

| Corn (maize) | 4 | 94% |

| Grape | 4 | 78% |

| Peach | 2 | 99% |

| Pepper (bell) | 2 | 100% |

| Potato | 3 | 90% |

| Strawberry | 2 | 97% |

| Tomato | 10 | 81% |



\## Dataset



\[New Plant Diseases Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset) by Vipoooool on Kaggle. Contains 70,295 training images and 17,572 validation images across 38 classes.
